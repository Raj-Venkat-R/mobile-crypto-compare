   # 🔐 Welcome to the Efficiency Analyzer Project

## 📘 Project Info

**URL**: [https://raj-venkat-r.github.io/mobile-crypto-compare/#/analyzer](https://raj-venkat-r.github.io/mobile-crypto-compare/#/analyzer)

Analyze and compare the **performance efficiency** of **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** and **RSA** algorithms.  
Get instant insights into encryption/decryption times, memory usage, battery impact, and security levels — all through an elegant, interactive web interface.

## 🧠 What Does This Project Do?

The **Efficiency Analyzer** helps users evaluate cryptographic algorithm efficiency through realistic simulation.  
It’s designed for **students, developers, and researchers** to understand how ECC and RSA perform under different key sizes and message lengths.

### ✨ Features
- ⚙️ Choose between **ECC** and **RSA**
- 🔑 Dynamic key size options
- 📏 Customizable message length (64–16384 bytes)
- ⚡ Real-time performance simulation:
  - Encryption time  
  - Decryption time  
  - Memory usage  
  - Battery impact  
  - Security level  
- 🎨 Built with **modern ShadCN UI**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Lucide icons**
- 🔔 Toast notifications via **Sonner**
